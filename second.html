            The Messages app on the iPhone allows you to send simple text messages, photos, GIFs and much more to your friends. The app icon is green with a white speech bubble and is likely to be one of the first icons on your iPhone screen. You’ll find the same icon on your iPad screen, and there’s also a Messages app on the Mac – except this time the icon is Blue (although that’s set to change in macOS Big Sur).

            If you’re a text messaging novice wanting to communicate with the grandkids, an SMS superstar new to the iPhone, or just wondering about the latest features in the Messages app, you’ve come to the right place. This article explains how to send an SMS, text message, iMessage or group message on an iPhone, and offers tips on sharing your location, photos, GIFs, videos and more.
